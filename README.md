# IS597MLC_Final_Project

## Machine Learning-Based Mushroom Edibility Assessment

1. The main notebook for the machine learning is the [Mushroom.ipynb](Mushroom.ipynb) in the root folder.
2. For this project we will be training a Gradient Boosting Ensemble Model and a Bagging Ensemble Model and comparing model's performances:
   1. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
   2. Random Forest
3. The dataset and metadata are located in the [Dataset](Dataset) folder.
4. Executing the whole scripts saves the two models in the [Models](Models) folder.
